  "doctor_text": "Good morning, Janet. How are you feeling today? That's excellent news. Can you tell me about the back pain? Is it still bothering you? I understand. The car accident was about three weeks ago, correct? And you were diagnosed with a whiplash injury? I see. Have you been following the physiotherapy sessions we recommended? That's great to hear. And the painkillers? Are you still taking them? Perfect. Based on your progress, I'm confident you'll make a full recovery. The whiplash injury is healing well, and with continued physiotherapy, you should be back to normal within six months. That's completely understandable. Just remember to continue the exercises and avoid any heavy lifting for the next few weeks. We'll schedule a follow-up in a month to monitor your progress. You're welcome, Janet. Take care, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns.",
  "patient_text": "Good morning, doctor. I'm doing much better, thank you. The neck pain has reduced significantly, and I can move my head more freely now. Yes, there's still some discomfort in my lower back, especially when I sit for long periods. But it's not as severe as it was right after the car accident. Yes, exactly. Three weeks ago. I was rear-ended while stopped at a traffic light. The impact was quite sudden. Yes, I've completed 8 out of the 10 sessions. The exercises have been really helpful for my neck. I do them every morning now. I've reduced them to just one at night before bed. During the day, I don't need them as much anymore. That's very reassuring, doctor. I was worried it might take longer. I'm really looking forward to getting back to my normal activities. Thank you so much, doctor. I really appreciate your help.",
